## Method that works
1. Per-test scores are independent -> bundle several bets, each gated to ONE
   test by its unique `w_tp`, and attribute them all from one submission.
2. When ours and Codex differ on a test, dump both command streams on a
   matching workload and diff. That found the #5 bug exactly.
3. Local reproductions match METRICS but not policy RESPONSES. They have
   mispredicted five times. Do not ship on their say-so.

## Levers ruled out on the calibrated fits (cooldown after r15)
- `order` (admission S/F/L/A): inert everywhere except #5/#6, both already tuned.
- `nfactor` (scales the Ntarget cap on the 9 tests with `w_c >= w_tp`, 1642 open
  points): inert across 0.05..64 on #9/#10/#3. The adaptive controller re-tunes
  Ntarget every 16-64 events so the seed is overwritten; even `nfactor=0`, which
  kills both cap and adaptation, changes nothing. Admission control never binds
  on these tests — their queueing is resource saturation.

## Recorded flaw (currently moot)
On #10 `exTdr` is 143.98 vs `exTpot` 0.41, so the adaptive rule calls `grow()`
("TDR dominates: admit faster"). Correct when underloaded, backwards when
saturated — and #10 runs its remotes at 99.6%. Moot only because Ntarget never
binds there.
